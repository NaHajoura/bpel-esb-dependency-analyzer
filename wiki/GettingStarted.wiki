===How to open a Workspace or Multi Workspaces===

bpel-esb-dependency-analyzer allows to open workspaces in two ways:

    # Open one Workspace â€“ analysis of dependencies between projects in one workspace.
      * File --> Open*

    # Open Multi Workspace - analysis of dependencies between projects in several workspaces
      * File --> Open Multi-Workspace*

===Analysis of dependencies between BPEL and ESB projects===

 "Project Dependencies"* shows the dependencies between BPEL and ESB projects

 "Depending on activity-based operations" shows the dependencies on the BPEL processes or ESB services that are called from activities(receive, invoke, etc.) that contain WSLD operations
